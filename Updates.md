Downloaded the data sets and merged them. I think I'm going to do some sort of NHL summary shiny app where you sort the data by conference.

March 28 beginning of class:

I decided to work with a different data set and started making some static graphs. I then made a plotly interactive graph and put it up in a shiny App.

March 28 end of class:

I added a selectize input into my shiny app and started to make the reactive data set. I ended class with some issues with that reactive data set that I need to figure out.

I have been trying to solve the issues with my shinyApp aithout success.
