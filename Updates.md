March 23:

Downloaded the data sets and merged them. I think I'm going to do some sort of NHL summary shiny app where you sort the data by conference.

March 28 beginning of class:

I decided to work with a different data set and started making some static graphs. I then made a plotly interactive graph and put it up in a shiny App.

March 28 end of class:

I added a selectize input into my shiny app and started to make the reactive data set. I ended class with some issues with that reactive data set that I need to figure out. 

March 30 beginning of class:

I have been trying to solve the issues with my shinyApp without success.

To get credit for this, you need to push your attempts. Your project is identical between the end of class on March 28 and the beginning of class on March 30. If you weren't able to get anything done, then you need to at least push a file with what you tried (or, give some of the websites you checked and tried things from....just __something__)


March 30 end of class:

I solved some issues but now I have some other issues with my reactive data set that I gotta figure out.


April 4 beginning of class:

I fixed the issues from before so that I have a working shinyApp. I also added a dashboard so that I have 3 pages to switch between. Also donwloaded some more data to add to the app.

April 4 end of class:

I worked on sizing the boxes displayed so that it all looks nicer. I also started to think about more ideas that I could add to my app. I think a radar map of proportions of scoring opportunities for goalies, and a radar map of how situations in which a player or team scored would be cool.

April 6 beginning of class:

I added some sub-menus to the app. I breifly tried out my idea from last class but it didn't really work with the data. 

April 6 end of class:

I added an extra tab that will contain my SYE which is some statistics regarding empty net attempts. I read in all the data necessary and created an interactive graph. I will need to make it look less messy by creating some sort of interactive data set. It's also worth saying that I changed my main app to the r script file named "test.R". It was just easier to work in a r script file.

April 11:

I added a 2 graphs to the new "empty net" page that I created last class. I'm currently working on creating some custom variables to filter the interactive graph I created before so that it will be easier to spot patterns.

April 13:

I changed a couple of lables and also fixed some issues with graphs extending past the page.

April 18 Before class:

I worked on changing the color of the interactive graph on the empty net page so that the color is different for different teams.
