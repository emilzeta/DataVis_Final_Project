Project Description:

My project had NHL data collected from the last couple of seasons. I used this data to create a "top-10 Â´shinyapp" where you could find the top-10 players, goalies and teams a wide range of statistics. You could filter by games played, situations and season. I also added an extra page containing visualizations for my SYE which was a study on empty net shots.

This project took a little from most of the visualizations we learned in class. The shiny app used multiple inputs that we learned in class to create interactive plotly graphs. I also added a lollipop graph to my SYE page, a graph which I hadn't seen until we made some in class. 

If I were to continue this project I would like to make more tables. The issue was that I couldn't make it look nice enough. I would also add some extra pages where you could compare players, goalies and teams head-to-head. I thought that would be pretty cool.
